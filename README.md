This is a Android custom control, which is used for changing page, you can swipe up and down slightly to change the page, just like the function of Browsing goods details in Taobao or JD Android clients. You can add whatever type of view such as imageview, scrollview, listview and even customview, as one page, because I used a simple factory pattern to Support all kinds of format.
